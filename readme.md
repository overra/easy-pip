# easy pip

easy pip makes it simple to request PIP on the first playing `<video>` in the current tab.

## why?

- reqesting PIP in most places currently requires right clicking the video (usually twice) and then clicking "Picture in Picture"
- sites like netflix are even more complicated

easy pip just requires a single click.
